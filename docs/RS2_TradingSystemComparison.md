### State Management Performance (Verified)

| **Aspect** | **RS2 Implementation** | **Performance Characteristics** |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Memory Usage** | ✅ Bounded | 10k keys per operation, configurable limits |
| **Cleanup Strategy** | ✅ Simple eviction | Alphabetical key removal, periodic cleanup |
| **Storage Backends** | ✅ In-memory + custom | Fast in-memory, extensible for persistence |
| **Key Partitioning** | ✅ Custom extractors | Flexible state organization |

| **Concurrent Access** | ✅ Thread-safe | Arc<Mutex> for shared state access |

**⚠️ Advanced Memory Management System**: RS2 implements a sophisticated multi-layered memory management system that goes beyond simple eviction strategies. The current implementation uses several complementary approaches for optimal performance and memory efficiency:

### **Multi-Strategy Memory Management**

#### **1. Alphabetical Eviction (Base Strategy)**
- **When**: Periodic cleanup every 1000 items processed
- **How**: Removes entries in alphabetical order when `max_size` is exceeded
- **Why**: Simple and fast for most streaming use cases

#### **2. Complete Clear Eviction (Aggressive Strategy)**
- **When**: Filter operations with high cardinality
- **How**: Completely clears the key set and rebuilds
- **Why**: More efficient for filter operations that don't need persistent state

#### **3. Time-Based Cleanup (Window Strategy)**
- **When**: Stream joins with time-based windows
- **How**: Removes items older than the window duration
- **Why**: Maintains only relevant items for time-based correlations

#### **4. Size-Based Eviction (Buffer Strategy)**
- **When**: Buffer overflow prevention
- **How**: Removes oldest items when buffer exceeds configured size
- **Why**: Prevents unbounded memory growth in join operations

#### **5. Pattern Size Limits (Specialized Strategy)**
- **When**: Pattern detection with large pattern buffers
- **How**: Limits pattern buffer to prevent memory overflow
- **Why**: Controls memory usage for complex pattern matching

### **Resource Tracking & Batching**

The system includes sophisticated resource tracking with batched operations every 100 items to minimize overhead while maintaining accurate memory usage statistics.

### **Configuration Constants**

```rust
const MAX_HASHMAP_KEYS: usize = 10_000;        // Max keys per operation
const MAX_GROUP_SIZE: usize = 10_000;          // Max items per group
const MAX_PATTERN_SIZE: usize = 1_000;         // Max items per pattern
const CLEANUP_INTERVAL: u64 = 1000;            // Cleanup every 1000 items
const RESOURCE_TRACKING_INTERVAL: u64 = 100;   // Track resources every 100 items
const DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE: usize = 1024;       // Default buffer size
```

This multi-strategy approach ensures optimal performance for different operation types while preventing memory leaks and maintaining predictable resource usage. For high-cardinality scenarios requiring true LRU behavior, consider implementing a custom storage backend with LRU capabilities.
